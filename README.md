# fake-word-generator
An API for generating fake words based on logical phonetic sound combinations

First, I would have to get a basic understanding of phonetics and define rules for how a word can sound (possibly allow custom rules to dictate word generation by users?). If possible, I am thinking of storing a list of letters or a combination of letters by their "sound type category", similarly to consonants and vowels.

The generator could return a word that has a certain length (or syllable count if easily implementable), a list or string of words, etc.

In addition, (unauthenticated?) users could come to the site, generate a couple words and save them to a list if they think the word is intriguing or funny enough for others to see. Users could also vote on the words, so that the "best" fake words are more easily seen.

A list of possible use cases:
- Fake names
- Filler data
- Laughing at the generated words
- Used to create a word for a definition that lacks a word
